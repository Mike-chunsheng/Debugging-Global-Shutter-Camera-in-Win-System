Debugging global shutter camera for high-speed capture
Many times, we need to capture or capture high-speed moving images or images. In order to avoid image distortion (rolling shutter effect), we need a camera with a global shutter to achieve it. If you can program, it is easy to implement it with a camera with a global shutter. If you cannot program, you can also use the method in this article to achieve it. Please note that the intention of this article is to provide simple guidance and not to accurately debug the scene. Please refer to the attachment for specific implementation methods:
